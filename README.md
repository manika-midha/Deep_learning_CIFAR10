# Deep_learning_CIFAR10

This project uses deep learning to do image classification.  
I have tried three different ways - created a Neural Network from scratch, used pre-trained model VGG16, used Transfer Learning (using VGG16) to do image 
classification and compared them using different metrics.  
**Softwares used** : Python3, Jupyter Notebook   
**Libraries used** : Matplotlib, Numpy, Tensorflow.  
**Dataset** : Cifar-10, link : https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html   
This dataset consists of thousands of images of 10 different objects. Each image is labelled,so we know which kind of image it is.  
Using this dataset, we can train our Neural Network to identify these objects.  
I have split the code in multiple jupyter notebooks to make it easy to understand.  
All the images present have been used for testing purpose in the code.
